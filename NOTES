- precipIntensity: A numerical value representing the average expected
  intensity (in inches of liquid water per hour) of precipitation
  occurring at the given time conditional on probability (that is,
  assuming any precipitation occurs at all). A very rough guide:
  - 0 in./hr. corresponds to no precipitation
  - 0.002 in./hr. corresponds to very light precipitation
  - 0.017 in./hr. corresponds to light precipitation
  - 0.1 in./hr. corresponds to moderate precipitation
  - 0.4 in./hr. corresponds to heavy precipitation
